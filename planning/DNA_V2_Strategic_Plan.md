```python
DNA_V2_PHASE_2A_CONFIG = {
    "dna_layers": [4, 6, 8],
    "layer_specialization": {
        4: "content_analysis",    # Early filtering
        6: "core_processing",     # Main computation
        8: "output_refinement"    # Final optimization
    },

```python
TPV_DNA_INTEGRATION = {
    "reasoning_complexity_routing": True,
    "tpv_influence_weight": 0.3,
    "adaptive_temperature": True,
    "reasoning_aware_experts": True
}
```
