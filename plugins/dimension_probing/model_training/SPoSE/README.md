The code is copied from [SPoSE's official repository](https://github.com/ViCCo-Group/SPoSE). You can refer to the official readme file to use. 

For convenience, we have written the model training instructions and configuration in a separate file, and you can run the SPoSE algorithm directly by executing the following commands to learn interpretable low-dimensional embeddings.

```bash
python get_spose_embedding.py
```
