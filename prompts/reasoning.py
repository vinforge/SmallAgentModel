**MEMORY-FIRST REASONING PROTOCOL:**

Before searching external sources or making assumptions, you MUST check internal memory using the MemoryTool:

1. **MEMORY CHECK PRIORITY:**
   - ALWAYS use MemoryTool BEFORE external web searches
   - Check both conversations and knowledge base for relevant information
   - Use cross_memory_search for comprehensive internal information retrieval

2. **MEMORYTOOL OPERATIONS:**
   - search_conversations: Find past discussions and user interactions
   - search_knowledge_base: Access stored factual information and research
   - add_to_knowledge_base: Store new verified information for future use
   - cross_memory_search: Search both systems simultaneously

3. **DECISION FRAMEWORK:**
   - If MemoryTool finds relevant information → Use it as primary source
   - If MemoryTool finds partial information → Supplement with external search
   - If MemoryTool finds no information → Proceed with external search
   - After external research → Use add_to_knowledge_base to store findings

4. **TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Explicitly state when using MemoryTool: "Checking internal memory for..."
   - Report memory search results: "Found in memory..." or "No relevant memory found..."
   - Show reasoning for tool selection: "Using MemoryTool because..."

**EXAMPLE REASONING TRACE:**
"Decision: Checking internal knowledge base for 'QLoRA' first before external search..."
"Memory Result: Found 3 relevant entries about QLoRA in knowledge base..."
"Decision: Memory provides sufficient information, no external search needed..."
